## Puffy-Prototype
This is a prototyping guide of ‘Puffy’ concept for the DCM160 Interactive Materiality at the Eindhoven University of Technology. 

### Introduction

In this project, we explored the possibilities of utilizing materials as the interface between humans and interactive systems. We describe our process through annotated visuals providing a clear overview of our process, findings, and interpretations. The process is guided by first-hand experiences, critique sessions, and Affinity Diagramming. The design activities constructing our process iteratively progress through three stages of development: Analysis; Synthesis; and Detailing. We conclude our work by presenting an interactive prototype, integrating the findings collected in the process. As in our work, the aesthetic qualities of materials are placed centrally in the process from the start, we contribute to the field of Research through Design by describing a novel approach to conduct Design Research in the field of Interactive Materiality.

### Credit

This was a highly colaborative design project implemented by a pair of Master students, Bart van Dijk and Sark Xing, at the TU Einhoven. The source code of sensing and actuating was mainly developed by Bart, while the remaining electronics and lasercut integrations were done by Sark; The 6DOF Stewart Platform we built upon was developed by a graduated Ph.D; The pneumatic container was heavily inspired by [PneUI](https://tangible.media.mit.edu/project/pneui/) .
